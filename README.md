Status
======

This library is still under early development and is still experimental.

Description
===========

This Lua library is a Kafka client driver for the ngx_lua nginx module:

http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule

This Lua library takes advantage of ngx_lua's cosocket API, which ensures
100% nonblocking behavior.

Note that at least [ngx_lua 0.9.3](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/tags) or [ngx_openresty 1.4.3.7](http://openresty.org/#Download) is required, and unfortunately only LuaJIT supported (`--with-luajit`).


Synopsis
========

```lua
    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-kafka/lib/?.lua;;";

    server {
        location /test {
            content_by_lua '
                local cjson = require "cjson"
                local client = require "resty.kafka.client"
                local producer = require "resty.kafka.producer"

                local broker_list = {
                    { host = "127.0.0.1", port = 9092 },
                }

                local key = "key"
                local message = "halo world"

                -- usually we do not use this library directly
                local cli = client:new(broker_list)
                local brokers, partitions = cli:fetch_metadata("test")
                if not brokers then
                    ngx.say("fetch_metadata failed, err:", partitions)
                end
                ngx.say("brokers: ", cjson.encode(brokers), "; partitions: ", cjson.encode(partitions))


                -- sync producer_type
                local p = producer:new(broker_list)

                local offset, err = p:send("test", key, message)
                if not offset then
                    ngx.say("send err:", err)
                    return
                end
                ngx.say("send success, offset: ", tonumber(offset))

                -- this is async producer_type and bp will be reused in the whole nginx worker
                local bp = producer:new(broker_list, { producer_type = "async" })

                local ok, err = bp:send("test", key, message)
                if not ok then
                    ngx.say("send err:", err)
                    return
                end

                ngx.say("send success, ok:", ok)
            ';
        }
    }
```

Modules
=======


resty.kafka.client
----------------------

To load this module, just do this

```lua
    local client = require "resty.kafka.client"
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### Methods

#### new

`syntax: c = client:new(broker_list, client_config)`

The `broker_list` is a list of broker, like the below

```json
[
    {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 9092
    }
]
```

An optional `client_config` table can be specified. The following options are as follows:

client config

* `socket_timeout`

    Specifies the network timeout threshold in milliseconds. *SHOULD* lagrer than the `request_timeout`.

* `keepalive_timeout`

    Specifies the maximal idle timeout (in milliseconds) for the keepalive connection.

* `keepalive_size`

    Specifies the maximal number of connections allowed in the connection pool for per Nginx worker.

* `refresh_interval`

    Specifies the time to auto refresh the metadata in milliseconds. Then metadata will not auto refresh if is nil.


[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### fetch_metadata
`syntax: brokers, partitions = c:fetch_metadata(topic)`

In case of success, return the all brokers and partitions of the `topic`.
In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.


[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### refresh
`syntax: brokers, partitions = c:refresh()`

This will refresh the metadata of all topics which have been fetched by `fetch_metadata`.
In case of success, return all brokers and all partitions of all topics.
In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.

resty.kafka.producer
----------------------

To load this module, just do this

```lua
    local producer = require "resty.kafka.producer"
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### Methods

#### new

`syntax: p = producer:new(broker_list, producer_config?, cluster_name?)`

It's recommend to use async producer_type.

`broker_list` is the same as in `client`

An optional options table can be specified. The following options are as follows:

`socket_timeout`, `keepalive_timeout`, `keepalive_size`, `refresh_interval` are the same as in `client_config`

producer config, most like in <http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerconfigs>

* `api_version`

    Specifies the produce API version. Default `2`. This requires Kafka server 0.10.0.0 or above.
    If you use Kafka 0.9.x, `api_version` should be `0` or `1`.
    If you use Kafka 0.8.x, `api_version` should be `0`.

* `producer_type`

    Specifies the `producer.type`. "async" or "sync"

* `request_timeout`

    Specifies the `request.timeout.ms`. Default `2000 ms`

* `required_acks`

    Specifies the `request.required.acks`, *SHOULD NOT* be zero. Default `1`.

* `max_retry`

    Specifies the `message.send.max.retries`. Default `3`.

* `retry_backoff`

    Specifies the `retry.backoff.ms`. Default `100`.

* `partitioner`

    Specifies the partitioner that choose partition from key and partition num.
    `syntax: partitioner = function (key, partition_num, correlation_id) end`,
    the correlation_id is an auto increment id in producer. Default partitioner is:

```lua
local function default_partitioner(key, num, correlation_id)
    local id = key and crc32(key) or correlation_id

    -- partition_id is continuous and start from 0
    return id % num
end
```

buffer config ( only work `producer_type` = "async" )

* `flush_time`

    Specifies the `queue.buffering.max.ms`. Default `1000`.

* `batch_num`

    Specifies the `batch.num.messages`. Default `200`.

* `batch_size`

    Specifies the `send.buffer.bytes`. Default `1M`(may reach 2M).
    Be careful, *SHOULD* be smaller than the `socket.request.max.bytes / 2 - 10k` config in kafka server.

* `max_buffering`

    Specifies the `queue.buffering.max.messages`. Default `50,000`.

* `error_handle`

    Specifies the error handle, handle data when buffer send to kafka error.
    `syntax: error_handle = function (topic, partition_id, message_queue, index, err, retryable) end`,
    the failed messages in the message_queue is like ```{ key1, msg1, key2, msg2 } ```,
    `key` in the message_queue is empty string `""` even if orign is `nil`.
    `index` is the message_queue length, should not use `#message_queue`.
    when `retryable` is `true` that means kafka server surely not committed this messages, you can safely retry to send;
    and else means maybe, recommend to log to somewhere.

Not support compression now.

The third optional `cluster_name` specifies the name of the cluster, default `1` (yeah, it's number). You can Specifies different names when you have two or more kafka clusters. And this only works with `async` producer_type.

#### send
`syntax: ok, err = p:send(topic, key, message)`

1. In sync model

    In case of success, returns the offset (** cdata: LL **) of the current broker and partition.
    In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.

2. In async model

    The `message` will write to the buffer first.
    It will send to the kafka server when the buffer exceed the `batch_num`,
    or every `flush_time` flush the buffer.

    It case of success, returns `true`.
    In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error (`buffer overflow`).


[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### offset

`syntax: sum, details = p:offset()`

    Return the sum of all the topic-partition offset (return by the ProduceRequest api);
    and the details of each topic-partition


[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### flush

`syntax: ok = p:flush()`

Always return `true`.

Installation
============

You need to configure
the lua_package_path directive to add the path of your lua-resty-kafka source
tree to ngx_lua's LUA_PATH search path, as in

```nginx
    # nginx.conf
    http {
        lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-kafka/lib/?.lua;;";
        ...
    }
```

Ensure that the system account running your Nginx ''worker'' proceses have
enough permission to read the `.lua` file.
